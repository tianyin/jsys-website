<p>The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) is a diamond open-access (no fees for authors or readers) journal that seeks to publish research that moves the field forward and will be of interest to the systems community. JSys emphasizes rigorous research that improves the state-of-the-art, even if the increment is modest. JSys requires that papers that put forth a new tool, benchmark, or software solution undergo Artifact Evaluation and make their artifact publicly available.</p>

<h3 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h3>

<p>JSys has multiple deadlines each year, each set at 11:59 PM GMT
<del>23:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)</del>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>March 1st <del>February 1st</del></li>
  <li>May 1st</li>
  <li>August 1st</li>
  <li>October 1st <del>November 1st</del></li>
</ul>

<p>For each deadline, reviews will be available within 1.5 month.
For example, for a work submitted by March 1st, JSys commits to provide initial reviews by April 15th.</p>

<h3 id="formatting-instructions">Formatting Instructions</h3>

<p>All text and figures must fit within a 7” x 9” text block, centered on the page, using two columns with .33 inches of separation. The paper should be typeset using a 10-point font (Times New Roman or similar) with a 12-point (single-spaced) leading.</p>

<p>The easiest (and recommended) way to follow these formatting instructions is to use the <a href="#template">JSys LaTeX template</a>.</p>

<h3 id="page-limits">Page Limits</h3>

<p>There is no page limit.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, we strongly encourage authors to make their paper as brief as possible. Reviewer time and attention are limited; a compelling case for the paper must be made in the first 12-14 pages.</p>

<h3 id="doi-and-bibliography">DOI and Bibliography</h3>

<p>JSys articles are assigned a Crossref DOI upon publication.</p>

<p>Consequently, every reference in the bibliography must include a DOI whenever available. The <a href="#template">JSys LaTeX template</a> includes everything necessary to display DOIs according to <a href="https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/">Crossref’s guidelines</a>. The only thing you have to do is fill in the DOI fields in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bib</code> file.</p>

<h3 id="template">Template</h3>

<p>The JSys LaTeX template is available on <a href="https://github.com/jsysresearch/template">GitHub</a>. To get started and build a sample PDF:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/jsysresearch/template.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>template
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="double-blind">Double-blind</h3>

<p>JSys reviews papers in a double-blind fashion: the reviewers do not know who the authors are, and the authors do not know who the reviewers are (until acceptance). The authors must make a good-faith effort to ensure the submitted document cannot identify the authors or their institution.</p>

<p>For example, if they build on their own prior work, it should be referred to in the third person (i.e., “The paper by Brown et al.” and not “Our previous paper”).</p>

<h3 id="arxiv">Arxiv</h3>

<p>JSys allows submission of papers already uploaded on Arxiv. However,</p>

<ul>
  <li>the title of the JSys submission must be different from the Arxiv submission, and</li>
  <li>the system’s name (if any) used in the two papers must be different.</li>
</ul>

<p>The authors should make a good-faith effort to preserve the double-blind nature of the JSys submission.
Please inform the Editor-in-Chief and Area Chairs if there is a previous Arxiv submission; this helps if reviewers unintentionally find the Arxiv paper.</p>

<h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>

<p>JSys does not forbid authors to advertise their work on social media.
However, do not link to the OpenReview submission, as doing so breaks double-blindness.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tweeting “We have done some work on FooBar, here’s the Arxiv paper” is fine.</li>
  <li>Tweeting “We have just submitted our work on FooBar to JSys! We are submission #42” is not fine.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>

<p>JSys encourages authors to make their code, data, and other artifacts open source.</p>

<p>However, if the open source repository is <em>not</em> anonymized, it should not be linked directly in the submitted paper, as doing so breaks double-blindness. Instead, one simple way to link an already published repository to your JSys submission is to use services such as <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/">Anonymous GitHub</a>.</p>

<!-- Making non-anonymized artifacts publicly available is fine as long as the system name in the public repository is different from the JSys submission. A short-hand for remembering this is that the open-source rules are similar to how Arxiv papers are handled. -->

<h3 id="copyright-and-originality-of-the-work">Copyright and originality of the work</h3>

<p>All work submitted to JSys must be original work. The authors must have the copyright for the submitted work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to JSys must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.</p>

<!-- <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> ****  
Papers will be publicly viewable on OpenReview upon submission.  
Authors requiring secrecy of their submitted work should take this into account. -->

<h3 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h3>

<p>When submitting your paper to JSys, you must provide information about conflicts with reviewers on the editorial board.
JSys considers the following cases as conflicts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The reviewer is your PhD or post-doc advisor.</li>
  <li>You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the reviewing period.</li>
  <li>You have collaborated with the reviewer on a publication, grant, or other academic projects in the past two years.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Students are conflicted with an institution only when they are doing an internship at that institution. For example, if Jane does an internship with X in summer 2020, and then another internship with X in summer 2021, Jane is free to review papers from X (provided they are not from her direct collaborators) as long as she is not currently doing an internship at X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Authors <em>must not</em> improperly identify a reviewer as in conflict if none of these circumstances applies; doing so may lead to the work being rejected without review. In particular, note that reviewers are <em>not</em> considered as conflicts if</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have reviewed the work before, or</li>
  <li>You have discussed the work with them, or</li>
  <li>They are your personal friend.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Editor-in-Chief and Area Chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the editor-in-chief and area chairs.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-evaluation">Artifact Evaluation</h2>

<p>JSys submissions for the Solution or Tools/Benchmark category must be accompanied by an Artifact. The JSys Artifact Evaluation Board evaluates the artifacts on two main aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Usability.  For an artifact to be considered “usable,” it should
satisfy the expectations set by the paper in terms of functionality
(does it basically work?) and relevance (does the artifact match the
paper?).  Beyond that minimum level of functionality, consider the
documentation, completeness, and exercisability of the artifact.  Is
the artifact easy to navigate, install, configure, and execute?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reproducibility.  The evaluator is asked to use the submitted
artifacts to obtain the main results presented in the paper: i.e.,
repeat some or all of the presented experiments in order to obtain
the same experimental outcomes.  The goal is <em>not</em> to reproduce the
results exactly, but instead to generate results independently
within an allowed tolerance such that the main claims of the paper
are validated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More details on the criteria and some useful references can be found on <a href="/artifact_evaluation/">the Artifact Evaluation page</a>.</p>

<p>Artifact Evaluation is single-blind and private (neither artifacts nor the reviews are made public); this is to allow authors to share access to their hardware or testing facility, if required.</p>

<p>The Artifact Evaluation proceeds <em>in parallel</em> of the paper evaluation; to be accepted, Solution and Tools/Benchmark papers <strong>must be accepted by both boards</strong>. Papers accepted by the Editorial Board that fail Artifact Evaluation will be given a revise decision, and will have three months to ensure their artifact passes Artifact Evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="revisions-and-review-process">Revisions and Review Process</h2>

<p>There are three possible editorial decisions for a paper submitted to JSys: Accept with shepherding, Revise, or Reject.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Accept with shepherding</dt>
  <dd>The paper can be accepted with minor edits that can be completed within one month. Thus, authors can submit on February 1st, get an acceptance decision by March 15th, and submit the final manuscript by April 15th. The final manuscript will be made immediately available online.</dd>

  <dt>Revise</dt>
  <dd>The paper needs work that will take more than one month. The authors can submit a revised version anytime in the next three months. A revision submitted on the 1st of a month will get a response by the 1st of the next month.
  If authors submitted on March 1st, and got a Revise decision on April 15th, they can submit by Jul 15th and get a final decision by Aug 15th. 
  <!-- <br/> -->
  A revision is a contract between the authors and the reviewers: as long as the authors complete the requested changes in good faith by the deadline, the paper will be accepted after a quick review. 
  <!-- <br/> -->
  However, the editors reserve the right to reject the paper if additional evidence indicates that the central hypothesis or result of the paper no longer holds.
  <br />
  <br />
  The revised manuscript is submitted using the same OpenReview forum used for the initial submission; use the "Revision" button to submit the revision, which must contain two parts:
  <ul>
    <li>A revision plan explaining the changes made, and how they address reviewer concerns;</li>
    <li>The revised manuscript with changes highlighted for easy reviewing.</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Reject</dt>
  <dd>The paper needs more than three months of work to be accepted to JSys. The authors cannot submit the same work for one year to JSys.
  A rejection decision usually stems from a fundamental mismatch between the work and the journal such as the work is too narrow or out-of-scope. Rejection decisions imply that, even with more experiments or revised writing (that can happen in three months), the paper would not be acceptable for the journal.
  <br />
  <br />
  We hope to reduce the number of rejection decisions by being clear about what would be acceptable for the journal.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="contemporary-work">Contemporary Work</h3>

<p>Any peer-reviewed work that was published (PDF available on the publisher’s website) less than two months prior to the initial submission is considered contemporary with the submission. Reviewers will not penalize the submission for not comparing with contemporary work. However, reviewers may ask for a qualitative comparison to be added in the final version of the submitted work.</p>

<h3 id="feedback-on-reviews">Feedback on Reviews</h3>

<p>The three reviews will be graded A/B/C by the authors in terms of helpfulness. These grades are only known to the editors and provide useful feedback about the reviewers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A means a constructive review,</li>
  <li>B means an average review,</li>
  <li>C means a poor review (i.e., the reviewer didn’t understand the paper, made a lot of mistakes, was unnecessarily aggressive, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewers with a history of poor reviews will be removed from the editorial board.</p>

<h3 id="return-without-review">Return without Review</h3>

<p>For every paper submitted to JSys, the Editors-in-Chief and Area Chairs will try to find expert reviewers. If they are unsuccessful, or if the relevant Editorial Board members already have been assigned their maximum load for the deadline, the paper will be returned to the authors without review (usually within a week or so).
Authors will be invited to resubmit to the next deadline, in which case their work will be reviewed in priority.</p>

<p>We believe this is a preferable outcome than overloading reviewers (thereby lowering the quality of reviews for everyone) or having paper reviewed by non-expert in a paper’s topic. We aim to tailor the editorial board size and expertise to prevent this situation from happening as much as possible.</p>

<h2 id="open-access">Open Access</h2>

<p>JSys applies the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license to all works it publishes.</p>

<p><img src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc/2.0/jp/88x31.png" alt="CC BY-NC badge" /></p>

<p>Under the CC BY-NC license, authors retain ownership of the
copyright for their work, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse,
reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in JSys, so
long as the original authors and source are cited, and the material is not used for commercial purposes. No permission is required from the authors nor the publisher.</p>

<h2 id="prices">Prices</h2>

<p>JSys does not charge any APCs or submission charges. It is completely free for the authors to publish their work in the journal.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Plagiarism is a serious form of dishonesty and fraud. Alike most scientific journals, JSys prohibits plagiarism and may take action against authors who commit them.</p>

<p>That being said, we trust our authors’ ethical behavior: JSys does not use any plagiarism checking system, until proven necessary.</p>

<h3 id="removal">Removal</h3>

<p>Once published, an article cannot generally be revised or removed.</p>

<p>We believe it is important to provide perpetual access to materials published whenever possible and appropriate. However, we will remove publications under special circumstances, including in the case of submission errors, rights violations, or inappropriate content. Please be aware, however, that even after the removal of a work, a citation to the work will remain in our system, along with a URL.</p>

<p>If you would like your work removed from JSys, please <a href="/contact/">contact the editors</a>.</p>

<h3 id="revising-work">Revising Work</h3>

<p>Once articles are published, we are generally unable to revise them.</p>

<p>If a significant error or omission is discovered, please <a href="/contact/">contact the editors</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rights-and-permissions">Rights and Permissions</h3>

<p>JSys does not require copyright transfer, only a non-exclusive permission to publish and archive the article.</p>

<p>Copyright holders retain copyright ownership, granting a non-exclusive license to the JSys and eScholarship to publish the article, meaning that the author may also publish it elsewhere. Before submitting an article to the journal, please be sure that all necessary permissions have been cleared in any third party material. All articles published in JSys are subject to the <a href="https://github.com/jsysresearch/community/blob/main/agreement.pdf">journal’s author agreement</a>.</p>

<h3 id="long-term-preservation-policy">Long-term preservation policy</h3>

<p>All materials submitted to JSys are automatically deposited in CDL’s <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/merritt/">Merritt Preservation Repository</a> for long-term preservation.</p>
