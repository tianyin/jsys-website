<p>The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) is a new journal covering the wide area of computer systems. JSys is a scholarly-led initiative aiming to address some limitations of today‚Äôs publishing outlets in computer science.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of JSys is to lift barriers that restrict the dissemination of and access to science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JSys is founded on its commitment to inclusiveness,¬†transparency,¬†and¬†quality. These values are supported by the following journal policies.</p>

<!-- ## üëê Inclusiveness  -->
<h2 id="--inclusiveness"><i class="fa-solid fa-hands-holding-circle"> </i> Inclusiveness</h2>

<ul>
  <li>JSys is <strong>diamond Open Access</strong>. That is, it is free to read and free to publish.</li>
  <li>JSys explicitly calls for <strong>several paper types</strong>, including¬†<a href="https://www.jsys.org/type_ToolBench/">Tool</a>,¬†<a href="https://www.jsys.org/type_problem/">Problem</a>, and¬†<a href="https://www.jsys.org/type_SoK/">SoK</a>¬†papers.</li>
  <li>JSys papers have <strong>no page limit</strong>, as system works sometimes need just more than 12 pages.</li>
  <li>JSys has <strong>four deadlines</strong> per year; the next one is never too far out!</li>
</ul>

<!-- ## üîç Transparency  -->
<h2 id="-transparency"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Transparency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>JSys adopts <strong>open peer review</strong>; reviews are made publicly available and linked to published papers.</li>
  <li>Reviewers should be both responsible and recognized for their work. JSys <strong>publishes the reviewer names</strong> together with the papers.</li>
  <li>Authors should get clear guidance to improve their work based on the review. Thus, JSys has a <strong>one-shot revision</strong> model where authors get a clear list of points to address to get the work accepted.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ## üíé Quality   -->
<h2 id="--quality"><i class="fa-solid fa-gem"></i>  Quality</h2>

<ul>
  <li>JSys commits to returns <strong>reviews within 6 weeks</strong> after submission.</li>
  <li>System works should be usable by others. Passing an <strong>Artifact Evaluation</strong> is mandatory for JSys‚Äô Tools and Solution papers.</li>
  <li>Every paper is reviewed by <strong>three board members¬†as well as one student reviewer</strong>. By taking part in reviewing, students get naturally integrated into the community‚Ä¶ plus, they tend to have a sharp eye for details <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile-wink"></i></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have works that fall in the scope of the journal areas, we‚Äôll be very happy to read about your ideas and help you improve further and disseminate your system works <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i></p>

<!-- Former description -->

<!-- The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) is a new journal with diamond-access publication model; that is, papers are free to read, submit, review, and publish.
Its design borrows heavily from similar journals recently created in the databases, security, and crypto communities.

JSys includes several interesting features.

<dl>
    <dt>One-shot Revisions</dt>
    <dd>
    Authors get a single chance to revise their papers based on reviewer comments, for which they have three months after getting the ‚Äúrevise and resubmit‚Äù decision.
    </dd>

    <dt>Quick Turn-Around</dt>
    <dd>Initial decisions will be returned to authors in 1.5 months. Final decisions after revisions will be returned to authors in 5.5 months (1.5 initial review + 3 months for revision + 1 month for reviewing revised manuscript). The paper will be published at the latest one month after the final accept decision.
    </dd>

    <dt>Light review load</dt>
    <dd>A common problem many conferences face is being unable to find enough reviewers for all their submissions. JSys will return manuscripts to authors if the appropriate reviewers are already fully occupied; authors can then choose to submit at the next quarterly deadline or submit to a different conference or journal. By doing so, JSys aims to ensure high-quality of reviews by making sure that reviewers are not overloaded.
</dd>

    <dt>No cap on number of accepted papers</dt>
    <dd>JSys is not tied to a conference, and hence does not have to consider constraints such as number of presentation slots. JSys will accept every paper deemed by reviewers as contributing to the field.
</dd>

    <dt>No page limits</dt>
    <dd>JSys recognizes that current conferences force authors into describing their systems and techniques in 12 to 14 pages, regardless of the complexity of these systems. While this provides focus and works well for some papers, it is detrimental to some papers which need more space for fully describing the system and experiments. JSys does not enforce page limits, either for the submitted version, or the final camera-ready version.
</dd>

    <dt>Multiple paper types  </dt>
    <dd>Authors can submit one of different types of papers: Solution, Problem, Systematization of Knowledge, or Tool/Benchmarks. Each paper type has its own purpose, goal, and corresponding expectations. Reviewers are provided guidance on how to rightly evaluate each type of paper.
</dd>

    <dt>Transparency in and credits for reviewing</dt>
    <dd>Each paper will have a ‚ÄúReviewed by‚Äù line containing the names of the JSys editorial board members who reviewed the paper. Prior to publication, the reviewers and authors work together to make the paper as strong as possible. This provides more transparency in the review process as well as fair credit for the work of reviewers.
